## Web App: Interactive dashboard for dataset exploration

### Description
The scope of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](data/samples.json), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
